I was sitting in classroom and we were going on for a new project work. It's okay but there is something with the groups: You want to choose your friends but the teachers don't want this. You dont want to count the classroom and split by this every time.. yeah things like this. So I want to have a easy application to handle this. Now I'm doing this.
